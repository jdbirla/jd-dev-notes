- Download .pem file [private key]

##  Getting Started With Elastic Beanstalk 
### Create application

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker_ecs.html
- Dockerrun.aws.json
```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": 2,
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "amigoscode-api",
      "image": "amigoscode/amigoscode-api:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 512,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "hostPort": 80,
          "containerPort": 8080
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL",
          "value": "jdbc:postgresql://TODO:5432/customer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- uplaod the Dockerrun.aws.json

- follow other steps to create application

- Application will be created
- Resource will be created: EBS, ECS, EC2, RDS
- As of now  DB won't connect becasue we didn't provide the correct host for DB
### Change the DB host
- update DB host into Dockerrun.aws.json
- upload and deploy updated Dockerrun.aws.json 
- We are getting error database "customer" doesn't exists
  
### Create Customer DB
- SSH into EC2 machine and using ec2 maching we will connect postgress db and create customer db
`ssh -i your-private-key.pem ec2-user@instance-public-ip-address`
- ssh "permissions are too open" ðŸ¤”

The error message "permissions are too open" occurs when the permissions on your SSH key files are too permissive, meaning they allow read or write access to users who should not have access. This can happen when the file permissions are set to 777 or similar values.
To fix this error, you can change the permissions on the SSH key files using the following command in your terminal:
```
chmod 600 <path-to-ssh-key>
```

This command sets the permissions on the SSH key file to 600, which means that only the owner of the file has read and write access, and no one else can read or write to the file.
If you still get the error message after changing the file permissions, you may also need to check the permissions on the directory that contains the SSH key files. The directory should have permissions set to 700, which means that only the owner can read, write, and access the directory.
```
chmod 700 <path-to-directory>
```

After changing the permissions on both the SSH key files and the directory that contains them, try connecting to your SSH server again. The error message should no longer appear.

- Windows Users

- To SSH to an EC2 instance on Windows, you can follow these steps:

    Download and install PuTTY, a free and open-source SSH client for Windows.
    Open PuTTY and enter the public DNS or IP address of your EC2 instance in the "Host Name (or IP address)" field.
    Under the "Connection" tab, select "SSH" and "Auth".
    Under "Auth", click "Browse" and select the private key file (.pem) for your EC2 instance.
    Go back to the "Session" tab, and give your session a name under "Saved Sessions", and click "Save".
    Click "Open" to start the SSH connection.
    If this is your first time connecting to the instance, you may see a security alert. Click "Yes" to continue.
    You should now be connected to your EC2 instance via SSH and can run commands in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to SSH to your EC2 instance. WSL provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface to Windows, allowing you to run Linux commands natively on Windows. You can follow these steps:

    Install WSL on your Windows machine.
    Install an SSH client on your WSL distribution. For example, you can install OpenSSH by running the command sudo apt-get install openssh-client.
    Follow the steps above to SSH to your EC2 instance, but use the SSH client installed in your WSL distribution instead of PuTTY.

Let me know if you get stuck
- We will connect using mobaxtream and SSH into EC2
- SSH into ec2 for postgresql connection
```sh
sudo -i
docker run --rm -it postgres:alpine bash
psql -U amigoscode -h host -d postgres 
or
psql -U amigoscode -h host -d ebdb
create database customer;
docker ps
docker logs -f container-id
```
- JD Practice
- As We need to connect postgress DB we need `psql` client there are two way for this either we can install psql in EC2 using
  `sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client` or we can run docke image of postgress DB which will default provid the psql client
```sh
