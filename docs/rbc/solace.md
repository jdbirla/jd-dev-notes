### **Key Differences in Decision-Making**
1. **Protocol Requirements**: If you need support for multiple messaging protocols (MQTT, AMQP, JMS), Solace is the clear winner. Kafka uses its proprietary protocol, while RabbitMQ supports AMQP primarily.
2. **Scale of Use**: Kafka is best for large-scale, distributed environments, whereas Solace shines in real-time and low-latency scenarios. RabbitMQ is ideal for smaller or less complex deployments.
3. **Ease of Setup**: RabbitMQ is simpler to configure and manage compared to Kafka or Solace.
4. **Replayability**: Kafka offers unmatched replay capabilities due to its log-based storage, whereas RabbitMQ has limited support. Solace offers good replay capabilities with persistent queues.
5. **Cloud-Native Support**: Solace is a leader in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, whereas RabbitMQ and Kafka focus more on either on-premises or single-cloud setups.

### **Conclusion**
- Choose **Solace** if you need **low latency, hybrid cloud flexibility, multiple protocol support, or IoT applications**. 
- Choose **Kafka** if you need **distributed, high-throughput, and log-based event streaming** for large-scale systems.
- Choose **RabbitMQ** if you want a **lightweight, traditional message broker** for simple task queues or low-complexity systems.
