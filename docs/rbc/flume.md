# Flume

## **What is Apache Flume?**

**Apache Flume** is a distributed, reliable, and available system designed for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large volumes of log data from various sources to a centralized data store, such as **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** or **Apache Kafka**. 

It is commonly used in Big Data ecosystems for log aggregation and real-time data ingestion.


## **Features of Flume**
1. **Log-Centric Design**:
   - Tailored for transporting log data, such as web server logs, application logs, or sensor data.
2. **Distributed Architecture**:
   - Supports distributed and scalable data collection.
3. **Customizable Sources, Channels, and Sinks**:
   - Sources pull data, Channels act as a buffer, and Sinks deliver data to the final destination.
4. **Reliability**:
   - Ensures fault-tolerant data flow with transaction-based guarantees.
5. **Extensibility**:
   - Supports custom sources and sinks to integrate with various data producers and consumers.
6. **Event-Based Processing**:
   - Data is moved as discrete events, ensuring efficient throughput.


## **Use Cases of Flume**
1. **Log Aggregation**:
   - Collects logs from multiple servers and delivers them to HDFS for storage and analysis.
2. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**:
   - Streams data to Apache Kafka or other real-time systems for processing.
3. **IoT Data Collection**:
   - Gathers data from sensors and devices for centralized storage or analytics.
4. **Clickstream Analysis**:
   - Captures user activity on websites and sends it to Hadoop for further analysis.
5. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**:
   - Acts as a lightweight ETL tool for simple preprocessing of streaming data before storage.


## **Components of Flume**
1. **Source**:
   - Captures data from an external source, such as a log file, network port, or event producer.
   - Examples: Avro, Syslog, Spooling Directory Source.

2. **Channel**:
   - Acts as an intermediary buffer between the source and sink.
   - Examples: Memory, File, JDBC.

3. **Sink**:
   - Delivers data to its final destination, such as HDFS, Kafka, or a custom system.
   - Examples: HDFS Sink, Kafka Sink.

4. **Agent**:
   - A single JVM process that hosts sources, channels, and sinks.
