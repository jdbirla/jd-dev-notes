## Java Libraries and Tools
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
   - Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.
Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, Automate your logging variables, and much more.
- [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/value/userguide/index.md)
    - https://www.baeldung.com/introduction-to-autovalue
    - Value classes are extremely common in Java projects. These are classes for which you want to treat any two instances with suitably equal field values as interchangeable. That's right: we're talking about those classes where you wind up implementing equals, hashCode and toString in a bloated, repetitive, formulaic yet error-prone fashion.
    - AutoValue is a source code generator for Java, and more specifically it‚Äôs a library for generating source code for value objects or value-typed objects.
In order to generate a value-type object all you have to do is to annotate an abstract class with the @AutoValue annotation and compile your class. What is generated is a value object with accessor methods, parameterized constructor, properly overridden toString(), equals(Object) and hashCode() methods.
- [Immutable objects](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html)
    - Java annotation processors to generate simple, safe and consistent value objects. Do not repeat yourself, try Immutables, the most comprehensive tool in this field!
- [Jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/)

    - Simply put, here‚Äôs how we can interact with the Twitter API; we can:
    - Post a tweet
    - Get timeline of a user, with a list of latest tweets
    - Send and receive direct messages
    - Search for tweets and much more
    - This library ensures that we can easily do these operations, and it also ensures the security and privacy of a user ‚Äì for which we naturally need to have OAuth credentials configured in our app.

- [FlexyPool](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool)
    - The FlexyPool library adds metrics and flexible strategies to a given Connection Pool, allowing it to resize on demand. This is very handy since most connection pools offer a limited set of dynamic configuration strategies.
    - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-flexypool-guide
    - In this tutorial, we‚Äôll learn how to use FlexyPool with Spring Boot and H2 using HikariCP. It‚Äôs a powerful connection pool manager built on top of major connection pools.
- [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j)
   - Resilience4j is a lightweight fault tolerance library designed for functional programming. Resilience4j provides higher-order functions (decorators) to enhance any functional interface, lambda expression or method reference with a Circuit Breaker, Rate Limiter, Retry or Bulkhead. You can stack more than one decorator on any functional interface, lambda expression or method reference. The advantage is that you have the choice to select the decorators you need and nothing else.
- [Zalando/problem-spring-web](https://github.com/zalando/problem-spring-web)
    - https://www.baeldung.com/problem-spring-web
