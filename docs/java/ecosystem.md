# Java
Java is a popular general purpose programming language. 

## Installation
Easy way to install Java is using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/)

``` bash
$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
$ sdk version
$ sdk list java
$ sdk install java 11.0.2-open
```

- [eclipse-collections](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections)
    - Eclipse Collections is a comprehensive collections library for Java. The library enables productivity and performance by delivering an expressive and efficient set of APIs and types. The iteration protocol was inspired by the Smalltalk collection framework, and the collections are compatible with the Java Collection Framework types.
    - Eclipse Collections is compatible with Java 8+. Eclipse Collections is a part of the OpenJDK Quality Outreach program, and it is validated for different versions of the OpenJDK.
- [RecordBuilder](https://github.com/Randgalt/record-builder)
    - Java 16 introduces Records. While this version of records is fantastic, it's currently missing some important features normally found in data classes: a builder and "with"ers. This project is an annotation processor that creates:
       a companion builder class for Java records an interface that adds "with" copy methods an annotation that generates a Java record from an Interface template
- [MapStruct ](https://mapstruct.org/)
   - MapStruct is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach. 
   - The generated mapping code uses plain method invocations and thus is fast, type-safe and easy to understand.
- [hypersistence-utils](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hypersistence-utils)
    - The Hypersistence Utils project gives you general-purpose utilities for both Spring and Hibernate.
    - The main advantage of this project is that it supports a broad range of Hibernate versions, spanning from Hibernate ORM 6.4, 6.3 to 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 5.3, and Hibernate 5.2.
- [high-performance-java-persistence](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/high-performance-java-persistence)
    - The High-Performance Java Persistence book and video course code examples. I wrote this article about this repository since it's one of the best way to test JDBC, JPA, Hibernate or even jOOQ code. Or, if you prefer videos, you can watch this presentation on YouTube.
- [ArchUnit ](https://www.archunit.org/)
   - ArchUnit is a free, simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of your Java code using any plain Java unit test framework. That is, ArchUnit can check dependencies between packages and classes, layers and slices, check for cyclic dependencies and more. It does so by analyzing given Java bytecode, importing all classes into a Java code structure. You can find examples for the current release at ArchUnit Examples and the sources on GitHub.
