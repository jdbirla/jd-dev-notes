Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Incorrect PF Date of Joining

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding my PF details. As you know, I joined IRIS on January 17, 2025. Due to delays in receiving my laptop and completing other onboarding trainings and formalities, I was unable to submit my PF details on time. However, I submitted all the required documents within five days.

Despite multiple follow-ups on the email thread, I did not receive any response from the onboarding team, and the StoHM portal remained inactive for PF declaration. As a result, I had to raise a support ticket (#75031) on the support hub. After several follow-ups, I finally received a response from the finance team stating that my PF details would be updated in February.

Upon checking the UAN portal in February, I noticed that my PF details were updated; however, my Date of Joining (DOJ) was incorrectly recorded as February 1, 2025, instead of my actual joining date, January 17, 2025. As per the regulations, my organization's Date of Joining and PF Date of Joining must be the same. If this discrepancy is not corrected, it could create problems for me in the future.

To address this issue, I raised another ticket on March 10 to request the correction. However, I was informed that the UAN Date of Joining cannot be updated. When I checked the UAN portal, I found that the Date of Joining can be corrected through a Joint Declaration process, but the finance team has denied this option.

I kindly request your assistance in rectifying this issue at the earliest. Please let me know the next steps and how we can proceed with the correction. Your prompt support in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response.
