Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Incorrect PF Date of Joining

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding my PF details. As you know, I joined IRIS on January 17, 2025. Due to delays in receiving my laptop and completing other onboarding trainings and formalities, I was unable to submit my PF details on time. However, I submitted all the required documents within five days.

Despite multiple follow-ups on the email thread, I did not receive any response from the onboarding team, and the StoHM portal remained inactive for PF declaration. As a result, I had to raise a support ticket (#75031) on the support hub. After several follow-ups, I finally received a response from the finance team stating that my PF details would be updated in February.

Upon checking the UAN portal in February, I noticed that my PF details were updated; however, my Date of Joining (DOJ) was incorrectly recorded as February 1, 2025, instead of my actual joining date, January 17, 2025. As per the regulations, my organization's Date of Joining and PF Date of Joining must be the same. If this discrepancy is not corrected, it could create problems for me in the future.

To address this issue, I raised another ticket on March 10 to request the correction. However, I was informed that the UAN Date of Joining cannot be updated. When I checked the UAN portal, I found that the Date of Joining can be corrected through a Joint Declaration process, but the finance team has denied this option.

I kindly request your assistance in rectifying this issue at the earliest. Please let me know the next steps and how we can proceed with the correction. Your prompt support in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response.

To **update the Date of Joining (DOJ) in the UAN portal**, follow these steps:  

### **1. Employer-Initiated DOJ Update (Recommended)**  
The employer must request the **DOJ correction** through the EPFO employer portal.  

#### **Steps for Employer to Update DOJ in UAN Portal:**  
1. **Employer logs in** to the EPFO Unified Employer Portal:  
   - [https://unifiedportal-emp.epfindia.gov.in/epfo/](https://unifiedportal-emp.epfindia.gov.in/epfo/)  
2. Goes to **"Member Profile"** and selects the employee's UAN.  
3. Clicks on **"Modify Basic Details"** and updates the **DOJ to 17th January 2025**.  
4. Uploads supporting documents (e.g., **appointment letter, salary slips**).  
5. Submits the request for **EPFO approval**.  
6. Once EPFO approves, the correction will reflect in the **UAN portal**.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** Ask your HR team to process this request as soon as possible.

### **2. Employee-Initiated DOJ Update via EPFiGMS (if employer refuses)**  
If your employer **denies updating DOJ**, you can raise a complaint with EPFO.  

#### **Steps to Raise a Complaint on EPFO Grievance Portal:**  
1. Go to **EPF i-Grievance Management System (EPFiGMS):**  
   - [https://epfigms.gov.in/](https://epfigms.gov.in/)  
2. Click on **‚ÄúRegister Grievance‚Äù**.  
3. Enter your **UAN and personal details**.  
4. Under **Grievance Category**, select **‚ÄúUpdate Date of Joining‚Äù**.  
5. Describe the issue:  
   - Mention that your **actual DOJ is 17th January 2025**, but it is incorrectly entered as **1st February 2025**.  
   - State that your employer is not updating it, causing PF contribution issues.  
6. Upload supporting documents:  
   - **Joining letter**  
   - **First salary slip (January 2025)**  
   - **Employment contract (if available)**  
7. Submit the grievance.  
8. You will receive a tracking ID; follow up regularly.  

üìå **Note:** EPFO may contact your employer for verification.

### **3. Visit the Nearest EPFO Office (Last Resort)**  
If the online request doesn‚Äôt work, visit your **regional EPFO office** with:  
- UAN details  
- Appointment letter  
- Salary slips  
- Written request for DOJ correction  

Would you like help in drafting an email to your employer requesting this update?


Since your **Date of Joining (DOJ) in the UAN portal is 1st February**, but you actually joined the organization on **17th January**, this discrepancy is key to your argument. Let‚Äôs address your questions based on EPFO rules.

### **1. Can an employer submit PF contributions for a backdated month?**
- **EPFO allows backdated contributions**, but **only if the employee‚Äôs UAN DOJ is corrected to reflect the actual joining date (17th January).**
- Employers **must declare the correct DOJ in the UAN portal** to ensure compliance. If they fail to do so, they will not be able to deposit PF for January.
- If your employer **incorrectly entered 1st February as the DOJ**, they **won't be able to deposit PF for January** unless they **correct the DOJ first** in the EPFO portal.

üîπ **Action:** Request your employer to update your **DOJ in the UAN portal to 17th January** and then process the backdated contribution for January.

üîπ **Reference:**  
- EPFO Circular No. WSU/15(1)2019/ATR/529, which allows correction of DOJ if incorrect data is submitted. ([EPFO Circulars](https://www.epfindia.gov.in/site_docs/PDFs/Circulars/Y2021-2022/WSU_DOJ_DOE_Correction_2021.pdf))

### **2. Is PF contribution mandatory if I was an active PF contributor in my previous company?**
- **Yes, it is mandatory.** If you were an EPF member in your previous company, your new employer **must continue your PF contributions from your joining date** (17th January).
- As per **EPFO rules**, an employee who is already a PF member in their previous company **must continue PF in their new company**, regardless of salary.

üîπ **Reference:**  
- **EPF Act, 1952, Section 26:** Once a person is a PF member, they cannot opt-out while switching jobs.
- EPFO FAQs: "If an employee was a PF member in the previous establishment, PF deduction is mandatory in the new establishment." ([EPFO Official Website](https://www.epfindia.gov.in/site_en/FAQ.php))

---

### **How to Proceed?**
1. **Ask your employer to correct your DOJ in UAN to 17th January.**  
   - This is necessary before they can pay the January PF.
2. **If the employer refuses, escalate the issue:**  
   - File a complaint on the **EPFO Grievance Portal** ([EPFiGMS](https://epfigms.gov.in/))  
   - Contact the **Regional EPFO Office** with your appointment letter and salary slips.
3. **If your employer does not comply, they may face penalties** for non-compliance.

Would you like help in drafting an email to your employer regarding this?

I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing regarding your Provident Fund (PF) contributions. Let's address your questions based on the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, and related guidelines.

**1. Can an employer submit PF contributions for previous months as per EPFO rules in India?**

Yes, employers are obligated to remit PF contributions for all eligible employees from the date of their joining, irrespective of when the employee's declaration is submitted. The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, mandates that both employer and employee contributions begin from the employee's date of joining. Failure to do so can result in penalties for the employer.ÓàÜ

**2. Is PF contribution mandatory if I was an active PF contributor in my previous company?**

Yes, PF contributions are mandatory for employees who were active PF members in their previous employment. The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) requires that such employees continue their PF membership with the new employer, ensuring continuity of their PF account. This is irrespective of the employee's salary exceeding the ‚Çπ15,000 threshold, as the existing PF membership necessitates continued contributions.ÓàÜ

**References:**

Given your situation, your employer is required to remit PF contributions from your date of joining, i.e., 17 January 2025. You may consider discussing these provisions with your employer to ensure compliance. If the issue persists, you can approach the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner or file a grievance on the EPFO's official website.ÓàÜ
