## Tools and Technologies portal
 - Using HTML , CSS knowledge bulding a static website and hosting into github pages.
 
## IG-Spring-AOP-impl
- Using Spring AOP we can solve problems like debugging in production/pre-production environment , no need to put explicityly log in method or clasees which needs to be removed later
- Will implement AOP and it will be configured dynamically using data base table
- i.e. If want log before and end time of method in a perticual class then we can insert a row in the table and update valid flag as Y then it will be enable and once that method will execute it will prin start and end time
- same as we can print input args in method and out of the method 
- we can implenment some common method in Aspect class already which will use all type of adivces lie before , after aourn etc... and print the information
